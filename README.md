# 🔋 Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling

## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores an energy-efficient CPU scheduling algorithm aimed at reducing power consumption while maintaining acceptable performance levels in modern computing systems. The goal is to design a scheduler that intelligently assigns CPU tasks to minimize energy usage without compromising on system responsiveness or throughput.

## 🎯 Objective

- Implement a CPU scheduler that dynamically adapts to workload characteristics.
- Reduce overall energy consumption using techniques like:
  - Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)
  - Task bundling and idle core scheduling
- Maintain fairness and responsiveness in task execution.
